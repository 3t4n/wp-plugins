Migrating your site(s) to the Liquid Web & Nexcess WordPress Hosting platform has never been so easy.

== Description ==

The Migrate to Liquid Web & Nexcess plugin makes it easy to migrate your site(s) to the [Nexcess Managed WordPress Hosting platform](https://www.liquidweb.com/products/managed-wordpress/). The plugin takes care of everything, from copying all the data to transforming config files and importing this to the Nexcess server. Start the migration, and the plugin will do all the heavy work!


== Installation ==

= There are two ways to install the plugin: =

1. Download the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in your WordPress admin panel.
2. Upload the migrate-to-liquidweb folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory through sFTP.

After installing you need to activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1) How do I migrate a website? =

For detailed instructions on how to migrate your site over, please visit [How to Migrate your Site to Nexcess](https://www.nexcess.net/help/migrating-to-nexcess-with-managed-wordpress-and-managed-woocommerce-hosting/)

= 2) Why do you need my email? =

We require an email address to send you updates on the migration process, notify you of any errors that occur during the migration.

= 3) How long does it take to migrate a website? =

This can range anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours depending on the size of the website. On average, migrations to Liquid Web take about 1 hour.

= 4) Can I migrate a site from WordPress.com? =

Currently you can only migrate a self hosted WordPress installation, the plugin does not support migrating from WordPress.com.

= 5) What happens if I run into an error after the migration is complete? =

We are always wanting to assist and help out in any way that we can. If you encounter any type of issue please use the support section of our plugin.

= 6) Do I need to leave the window open while the migration is processing? =

No, that's the beauty of this plugin. It runs on a SAAS-based technology and a secure web address that runs everything in the background. Once you start the migration you can close the window at any time and come back to it later while it's still running, no need to wait for hours. You will also receive an email once the migration has completed.

= 7) Can this plugin be used to migrate to Liquid Web VPS plans? =

BlogVault is designed to be used to migrate to Managed WordPress and Managed WooCommerce plans on Nexcess and does not support WordPress sites running on VPS plans on Liquid Web.
